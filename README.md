 (Please visit the website is better documented)

1.
Go to the folder where you have downloaded the code and give it execute permissions:

$ chmod +x on_led.sh

$ chmod +x off_led.sh



 

2.

Copy the 2 .sh files to /usr/local/bin (it requires sudo permissions)

$ sudo cp on_led.sh /usr/local/bin

$ sudo cp off_led.sh /usr/local/bin


 
3.

Now just type :

$ on_led.sh  –To turn on

$ off_led.sh  –To turn off

on_off

And is that its all ready to go.
